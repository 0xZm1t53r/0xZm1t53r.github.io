The stand and enclosures for buttons were designed by myself and 3D-printed using PLA plastic.

This how the setup looks like (JTAGulator remained connected from previous post):

top:

The top bed of the stand can be lifted up and down and rotated, allowing easy access to both sides of a board.

In general, I am very happy with this solution, but a few things annoy me: the battery and LCD.
