I decided to spend some time and figure out the purpose of some test points.
Also, I desolder all components from my broken main board(just for fun :) ).

Now the main board looks like this:
Top:
![]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/pcb_without_elements_top.jpeg)

Bottom:
![]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/pcb_without_elements_bottom.jpeg)

### Founded results

**TP**xx - is my labeling of unknown test points.

SoC JTAG pins and N52832 JTAG pins are among the most interesting findings.
